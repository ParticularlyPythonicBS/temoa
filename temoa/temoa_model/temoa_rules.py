    This constraint ensures that the capacity of a given process is sufficient
    to support its activity across all time periods and time slices. The calculation
    on the left hand side of the equality is the maximum amount of energy a process
    can produce in the timeslice :code:`(s,d)`. Note that the curtailment variable
    shown below only applies to technologies that are members of the curtailment set.
    Curtailment is necessary to track explicitly in scenarios that include a high
    renewable target. Without it, the model can generate more activity than is used
    to meet demand, and have all activity (including the portion curtailed) count
    towards the target. Tracking activity and curtailment separately prevents this
    possibility.

with an end-of-life (EOL) on a period boundary, all of its capacity is available

for any process with an EOL that falls between periods, Temoa makes the
simplifying assumption that the available capacity from the expiring technology
is available through the whole period in proportion to its remaining lifetime.
For example, if a process expires 3 years into an 8-year model time period,

def TotalCost_rule(M):
    r"""

    Using the :code:`FlowOut` and :code:`Capacity` variables, the Temoa objective
    function calculates the cost of energy supply, under the assumption that capital
    costs are paid through loans. This implementation sums up all the costs incurred,
    and is defined as :math:`C_{tot} = C_{loans} + C_{fixed} + C_{variable}`. Each
    term on the right-hand side represents the cost incurred over the model
    time horizon and discounted to the initial year in the horizon (:math:`{P}_0`).
    The calculation of each term is given below.

    .. math::
       :label: obj_loan

       C_{loans} = \sum_{r, t, v \in \Theta_{IC}} \left (
         \left [
                 CI_{r, t, v} \cdot LA_{r, t, v}
                 \cdot \frac{(1 + GDR)^{P_0 - v +1} \cdot (1 - (1 + GDR)^{-LLP_{r, t, v}})}{GDR} \right. \right.
                 \\ \left. \left. \cdot \frac{ 1-(1+GDR)^{-LPA_{r,t,v}} }{ 1-(1+GDR)^{-LTP_{r,t,v}} }
         \right ]
         \cdot \textbf{CAP}_{r, t, v}
         \right )

    Note that capital costs (:math:`{IC}_{r,t,v}`) are handled in several steps. First, each capital cost
    is amortized using the loan rate (i.e., technology-specific discount rate) and loan
    period. Second, the annual stream of payments is converted into a lump sum using
    the global discount rate and loan period. Third, the new lump sum is amortized
    at the global discount rate and technology lifetime. Fourth, loan payments beyond
    the model time horizon are removed and the lump sum recalculated. The terms used
    in Steps 3-4 are :math:`\frac{ GDR }{ 1-(1+GDR)^{-LTP_{r,t,v} } }\cdot
    \frac{ 1-(1+GDR)^{-LPA_{t,v}} }{ GDR }`. The product simplifies to
    :math:`\frac{ 1-(1+GDR)^{-LPA_{r,t,v}} }{ 1-(1+GDR)^{-LTP_{r,t,v}} }`, where
    :math:`LPA_{r,t,v}` represents the active lifetime of process t in region r :math:`(r,t,v)`
    before the end of the model horizon, and :math:`LTP_{r,t,v}` represents the full
    lifetime of a regional process :math:`(r,t,v)`. Fifth, the lump sum is discounted back to the
    beginning of the horizon (:math:`P_0`) using the global discount rate. While an
    explicit salvage term is not included, this approach properly captures the capital
    costs incurred within the model time horizon, accounting for technology-specific
    loan rates and periods.

    The Demand constraint drives the model.  This constraint ensures that supply at
    least meets the demand specified by the Demand parameter in all periods and
    slices, by ensuring that the sum of all the demand output commodity (:math:`c`)
    generated by both commodity flow at the time slice level (:math:`\textbf{FO}`) and
    the annual level (:math:`\textbf{FOA}`) must meet the modeler-specified demand

    :math:`C^d` set is distinct from both :math:`C^e` and :math:`C^p`. In other

    For end-use demands, it is unreasonable to let the model arbitrarily shift the
    use of demand technologies across time slices. For instance, if household A buys
    a natural gas furnace while household B buys an electric furnace, then both units
    should be used throughout the year.  Without this constraint, the model might choose
    to only use the electric furnace during the day, and the natural gas furnace during the
    night.

    This constraint ensures that the ratio of a process activity to demand is
    constant for all time slices.  Note that if a demand is not specified in a given
    time slice, or is zero, then this constraint will not be considered for that
    slice and demand.  This is transparently handled by the :math:`\Theta` superset.

def CommodityBalance_Constraint(M: 'TemoaModel', r, p, s, d, c):
    r"""
    Where the Demand constraint :eq:`Demand` ensures that end-use demands are met,
    the CommodityBalance constraint ensures that the endogenous system demands are
    met.  This constraint requires the total production of a given commodity
    to equal the amount consumed, thus ensuring an energy balance at the system
    level. In this most general form of the constraint, the energy commodity being
    balanced has variable production at the time slice level. The energy commodity
    can then be consumed by three types of processes: storage technologies, non-storage
    technologies with output that varies at the time slice level, and non-storage
    technologies with constant annual output.

    Separate expressions are required in order to account for the consumption of
    commodity :math:`c` by downstream processes. For the commodity flow into storage
    technologies, we use :math:`\textbf{FI}_{r, p, s, d, i, t, v, c}`. Note that the FlowIn
    variable is defined only for storage technologies, and is required because storage
    technologies balance production and consumption across time slices rather than
    within a single time slice. For commodity flows into non-storage processes with time
    varying output, we use :math:`\textbf{FO}_{r, p, s, d, i, t, v, c}/EFF_{r, i,t,v,o}`.
    The division by :math:`EFF_{r, c,t,v,o}` is applied to the output flows that consume
    commodity :math:`c` to determine input flows. Finally, we need to account
    for the consumption of commodity :math:`c` by the processes in
    :code:`tech_annual`. Since the commodity flow of these processes is on an
    annual basis, we use :math:`SEG_{s,d}` to calculate the consumption of
    commodity :math:`c` in time-slice :math:`(s,d)` from the annual flows.
    Formulating an expression for the production of commodity :math:`c` is
    more straightforward, and is simply calculated by
    :math:`\textbf{FO}_{r, p, s, d, i, t, v, c}`.

    In some cases, the overproduction of a commodity may be required, such
    that the supply exceeds the endogenous demand. Refineries represent a
    common example, where the share of different refined products are governed
    by TechOutputSplit, but total production is driven by a particular commodity
    like gasoline. Such a situtation can result in the overproduction of other
    refined products, such as diesel or kerosene. In such cases, we need to
    track the excess production of these commodities. To do so, the technology
    producing the excess commodity should be added to the :code:`tech_flex` set.
    This flexible technology designation will activate a slack variable
    (:math:`\textbf{FLX}_{r, p, s, d, i, t, v, c}`) representing
    the excess production in the :code:`CommodityBalanceAnnual_Constraint`. Note
    that the :code:`tech_flex` set is different from :code:`tech_curtailment` set;
    the latter is technology- rather than commodity-focused and is used in the
    :code:`Capacity_Constraint` to track output that is used to produce useful
    output and the amount curtailed, and to ensure that the installed capacity
    covers both.

    This constraint also accounts for imports and exports between regions
    when solving multi-regional systems. The import (:math:`\textbf{FIM}`) and export
    (:math:`\textbf{FEX}`) variables are created on-the-fly by summing the
    :math:`\textbf{FO}` variables over the appropriate import and export regions,
    respectively, which are defined in :code:`temoa_initialize.py` by parsing the
    :code:`tech_exchange` processes.

    Finally, for commodities that are exclusively produced at a constant annual rate, the
    :code:`CommodityBalanceAnnual_Constraint` is used, which is simplified and
    reduces computational burden.

    This constraint tracks the storage charge level (:math:`\textbf{SL}_{r, p, s, d, t, v}`)
    assuming ordered time slices. The initial storage charge level is optimized
    for the first time slice in each period, and then the charge level is updated each time
    slice based on the amount of energy stored or discharged. At the end of the last time
    slice associated with each period, the charge level must equal the starting charge level.
    In the formulation below, note that :math:`\textbf{stored\_energy}` is an internal model
    decision variable.

    First, the amount of stored energy in a given time slice is calculated as the
    difference between the amount of energy stored (first term) and the amount of energy
    dispatched (second term). Note that the storage device's roundtrip efficiency is applied

    charge level (:math:`\textbf{SL}_{r,p,s,d,t,v}`) is updated, but the update procedure varies

    Because the number and duration of time slices are user-defined, we need to adjust
    the storage duration, which is specified in hours. First, the hourly duration is divided
    by the number of hours in a year to obtain the duration as a fraction of the year.
    Since the :math:`C2A` parameter assumes the conversion of capacity to annual activity,
    we need to express the storage duration as fraction of a year. Then, :math:`SEG_{s,d}`
    summed over the time-of-day slices (:math:`d`) multiplied by 365 days / yr yields the
    number of days per season. This step is necessary because conventional time sliced models
    use a single day to represent many days within a given season. Thus, it is necessary to

    The ramp rate constraint is utilized to limit the rate of electricity generation
    increase and decrease between two adjacent time slices in order to account for
    physical limits associated with thermal power plants. Note that this constraint
    only applies to technologies with ramp capability, which is defined in the set
    :math:`T^{m}`. We assume for simplicity the rate limits for both
    ramp up and down are equal and they do not vary with technology vintage. The
    ramp rate limits (:math:`r_t`) for technology :math:`t` should be expressed in
    percentage of its rated capacity.

    Note that when :math:`d_{nd}` is the last time-of-day, :math:`d_{nd + 1} \not \in
    \textbf{D}`, i.e., if one time slice is the last time-of-day in a season and the
    other time slice is the first time-of-day in the next season, the ramp rate
    limits between these two time slices can not be expressed by :code:`RampUpDay`.
    Therefore, the ramp rate constraints between two adjacent seasons are
    represented in :code:`RampUpSeason`.

    In the :code:`RampUpDay` and :code:`RampUpSeason` constraints, we assume
    :math:`\textbf{S} = \{s_i, i = 1, 2, \cdots, ns\}` and

def TechOutputSplit_Constraint(M: 'TemoaModel', r, p, s, d, t, v, o):
    r"""

    Some processes take a single input and make multiple outputs, and the user would like to
    specify either a constant or time-varying ratio of outputs per unit input.  The most
    canonical example is an oil refinery.  Crude oil is used to produce many different refined
    products. In many cases, the modeler would like to specify a minimum share of each refined
    product produced by the refinery.

    For example, a hypothetical (and highly simplified) refinery might have a crude oil input
    that produces 4 parts diesel, 3 parts gasoline, and 2 parts kerosene.  The relative
    ratios to the output then are:

    .. math::

       d = \tfrac{4}{9} \cdot \text{total output}, \qquad
       g = \tfrac{3}{9} \cdot \text{total output}, \qquad
       k = \tfrac{2}{9} \cdot \text{total output}

    Note that it is possible to specify output shares that sum to less than unity. In such
    cases, the model optimizes the remaining share. In addition, it is possible to change the
    specified shares by model time period. Under this constraint, only the
    technologies with variable output at the timeslice level (i.e., NOT in the
    :code:`tech_annual` set) are considered.

    The constraint is formulated as follows:

    .. math::
